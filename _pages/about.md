I’m Peter, 19, and out to tackle challenges that leave an impact on the community and solve real problems. I’m especially fascinated by machine learning and particularly deep learning. I feel these fields are the closest mankind has ever come to magic and, frankly, I've always wanted to be a wizard.

I’m currently a first year CS student at Technical University of Munich (TUM). I've worked on smart, unsupervised energy-monitoring algorithms at the Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems at the University of Klagenfurt, inter-process communication techniques at the Chair for Database Systems at TUM, chatbots at Google and currently chat backends at Bloomberg.

I also love and live open-source, so you’ll find my second home to be [Github](https://github.com/goldsborough). I maintain two blogs, this one here and also an [old one](http://thecodeinn.blogspot.com), where I write technology-related articles to give back to the community. Also, I have given tech talks at the Python Meetup in Munich, at PyConUK 2016 in Cardiff and at the Cambridge Academy, on the topic of *Deep Learning with TensorFlow*.

In the future, I see myself mostly doing machine learning and fixing the world.
